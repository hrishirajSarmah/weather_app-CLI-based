# Weather App (CLI Based)
A simple CLI based weather app, written using Python. It uses OpenWeather API to fetch weather data, and displays them in the form of a table using numpy and pandas. <br>
I have replaced the API key with garbage, but if anyone wants to use this program, please input your own API key generated by the website.
